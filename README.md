“unquantized.ipynb” contains codes for the unquantized model as well as the compilation, classification accuracy, and runtime results.
"quantized.ipynb” contains codes for the quantized model with int8, int16, and int32. It also contains the compilation, classification accuracy, and runtime results.
“runtime.ipynb” contains well-arranged codes for the quantized model with int8, int16, and int32. It also contains the compilation, classification accuracy, and runtime results. 
The notebook may not be able to open on GitHub due to the size of the quantization output. You can download the notebooks and open them using the VS code instead.
The Branch Master contains all the files, including the TVM environment and quantization codes. It also includes some tests I made and sample codes I used, which are stored in the TVM folder.
